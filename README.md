Lead Data Analyst II ft. Passport Adventures

I orchestrate end-to-end analytics projects that inspire strategy and decision-making and serve as a thought partner to highly visible TA projects. While building my career, I enjoy flying through different time zones, exploring vibrant cultures, and getting a taste of the locals' favorites dishes.
